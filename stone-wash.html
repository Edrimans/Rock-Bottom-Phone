              Stone-washed jeans have been a staple in casual fashion for decades, valued for their soft, worn-in feel and distinct faded appearance. Unlike raw or untreated denim, which starts out stiff and dark, stone-washed jeans undergo a special process that gives them a more comfortable, relaxed fit and a broken-in look right from the start. This unique finishing technique is what sets stone-washed jeans apart and makes them a beloved choice for people who want the rugged, casual look of denim without the lengthy break-in period.

              " refers to the process of washing denim fabric with actual stones—typically pumice stones. <br />
              <br />During this process, the jeans are placed in large industrial washing machines along with the stones. 
              As the machine agitates, the stones rub against the fabric, physically wearing down the surface of the denim.
              This abrasion lightens the fabric and gives it a faded, distressed look that varies from one pair of jeans to another.
              The longer the jeans are tumbled with the stones, the more faded and worn they become. 
              This process not only affects the appearance of the jeans but also their texture.
              Raw denim can be quite stiff when new, requiring weeks or even months of wear before it begins to soften and conform to the wearer’s body.
              <br /><br />Stone washing speeds up this process, resulting in jeans that are soft and comfortable from the first time you put them on. 
              This makes stone-washed jeans a popular choice for people who value comfort and ease of movement in their everyday wear. 
              Stone washing was first popularized in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the growing trend for casual, lived-in styles. Denim, 
              long associated with workwear and durability, began to take on a new identity as a fashion statement.
              People no longer wanted their jeans to look stiff and brand new; instead, they preferred a relaxed, 
              worn look that spoke of character and individuality.
